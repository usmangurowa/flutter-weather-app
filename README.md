Currently, the app has two screens.
- The first screen shows a list of cities, with the name of the city as the title and the temperature as a subtitle.
- On tapping any city, it will lead to the second screen.
- The second screen is a detailed screen for each city's weather, showing more information regarding that city.
- Using Provider for state management, the detail for the current weather is being set upon tapping on any city before navigating to the detailed screen.

  Currently, the data are not fetched from an API, but from an array in the app.
